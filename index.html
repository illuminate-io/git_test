        <p>So this is not my first website. I started "coding" web pages when I was a young lad, but I stopped and never really continued. I regret it, but here I am trying to get back into it.</p>

        <p><h2>This is supposed to be a blog</h2></p>

        <p>This is supposed to be a blog, so I'm going to just make it into a blog, I guess.</p>
